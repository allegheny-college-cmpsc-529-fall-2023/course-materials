## Course Structure

In this course students work as a team of engineers to implement a software tool specified by a 
company partner. This semester, our industry partners are Bull Moose Marketing and NetApp. Throughout 
the semester, students meet with the industry mentors and supervisors for 
regular meetings to outline what has been completed, what challenges were encountered, and project
management and planning. Industry mentors will also be available to answer students' questions during
common working hours and asynchronously, as necessary. 

## Learning objectives

* Gather and analyze requirements for creating high-quality software products for industrial application
* Develop software using professional methodologies such as, but not limited to, Agile or other well-defined processes
* Generate documentation and other materials describing installation, maintenance, use, and known issues to hand off project to industrial partner(s)
* Review and report on challenges, successes, and overall status of an in-progress or complete software product to an audience of industry professionals

## Expectations

- Dedication of 8-9 hours of work per week to the project
- Regular attendance to:
  * Schedule partner meetings
  * Course work time
  * Working time scheduled outside of formally-structured hours
- Regular communication with partner team(s)
- Participation in processes provided by the project partner
- Completion of tasks assigned

### Course work time



## Deliverables

* Final presentation
* Work product consistent with partner team expectations

## Policies

### Grading

Grading for this course hinges on a rubric (linked below) shared with students and industrial partners.
The project teams with which you're associated will be asked to fill out a rubric for each participating
student two (2) times during the semester: at midterm and at the conclusion of the course. The course
instructor will use this feedback to chart an individual participant's growth and dedication to the task(s)
required by the industrial partner project to which they are assigned.

This feedback will be shared with individual participants in the internship course, and aggregate, anonymized
data may be shared with a project team in order to summarize iterative or overall performance.

### Allegheny College statement of community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe 
> residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, 
> heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage 
> individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust 
> and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, 
> Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the 
> same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This 
> statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These 
serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that 
your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of 
code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly 
> in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and 
> fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully 
> between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student 
> who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone elseâ€™s work.  It 
> will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of 
> Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should 
> be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken 
> when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department 
encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code 
provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to 
discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing 
Machinery (ACM) [Code of 
Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to 
seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor's assistance 
should schedule an appointment through the instructor of record's [Office Hour

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which interfere with your ability to participate in

ask for exceptions to what is stated in this syllabus.
